# Protect My Choices v2.0 (Beta): How to read the AdChoices Signal 

## Background

When consumers install the Protect My Choices (v2.0) extension – which is currently available for the desktop versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox and the desktop and mobile versions of Apple Safari – any preferences expressed through the WebChoices tool will be stored as a string in the extension, according to the AdChoices Signal specification document. The value of this string can be read by any participant with the code on page.

## Accessing User Preferences | JavaScript ‘Reader’

Web participants can access these user preferences from the extension, as required and when available, in real time. Vendors who serve ads or collect data about users, such as ad servers, exchanges, DSPs, DMPs, CDPs, etc., will need to listen for the “**ExtensionLoaded**” event name on the top application level. This sample JS code confirms that the extension was loaded:

`window.addEventListener('message', (event) \=\> {  
    if (event.data.type \=== "ExtensionLoaded") {  
        // Do something when the extension is loaded  
    }  
});`

If the extension is loaded, the following JavaScript code retrieves the user preference string: 

`window.postMessage({type: "GetAdPreferences"}, "\*");`

When combined, the implementation code should look something like this:

`window.addEventListener('message', (event) \=\> {  
  if (event.data.type \=== "ExtensionLoaded") {  
    window.postMessage({type: "GetAdPreferences"}, "\*");  
  } else if (event.data.type \=== "AdPreferences") {  
    const adPrefs \= event.data.data; // Store preferences  
    }  
});`

Vendors should send the preference string to themselves so that it can be passed on to other parties. If vendors need to know the users’ preferences before ad decisioning, they should delay ad decisioning until after retrieving the string.[^1]

## Accessing User Preferences | Header String

Participating vendors may also access user choices via a header string created by the Protect My Choices 2.0 extension. When users have the extension installed, the extension will insert the "X-Adchoices" (Chrome) or “Cookie2” (Safari) string into a header to be attached to every request on any website. The header value can then be decoded to interpret the AdChoices Signal as demonstrated in the examples below.[^2]

### Example 3: Global Preference Only (for IBA)

#### **Base64 (base64url):**

#### **Binary:**

000001011000010101000111100010010110010000000000000000000000000000

#### **Annotated Binary:**

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 000001 | *(Header Section)* Version | Version 1 of the specification is used. |
| 01100001010100011110001001011001 | Timestamp | 1632756313 seconds since epoch, or Monday, September 27, 2021 3:25:13 PM UTC. |

| 000000000000   | *(Per-Category Records Section)* Number of Per-Category Records | 0 per-category records will follow. |


In this example, there are no per-participant or per-category records, so no such records appear, however the number of per-participant or per-category records fields are always required for correct parsing.

#### Important note:
In all of the aforementioned examples, the binary strings are constructed first, according to the AdChoices string specification. The base64url value is derived by converting the binary to base64url. Converting the base64url values back to binary can result in values that don’t 100% match the original binary strings. This is because of padding (extra zeros) added to the end of the string due to the conversion process. This extra padding should be ignored when parsing the binary strings. (Given that the strings include fields for “number of per-participant records” and “number of per-category records,” it will be evident when the padding begins.)

For example, a binary string according to the spec may look like this:  
000001011000010101000111100010010110010010000000000011000000000001000000000000001000010000000000110000000000000000

But when the same string is decoded from its base64url value, it looks like this:  
000001011000010101000111100010010110010010000000000011000000000001000000000000001000010000000000110000000000000000**000000**

The strings are identical except for the added zeros at the end. If not accounted for, this may cause some automated tests to fail.
