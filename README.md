# DAA Choice Tools — Technical Documentation

This GitHub repository serves as a centralized resource for the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program specifications related to Interest-Based Advertising (IBA), also known as online behavioral advertising (OBA). It is designed for product managers and engineers who need to understand and implement these specifications to promote enhanced transparency and consumer control over data collection and use for online advertising.

The DAA-family Self-Regulatory Programs aim to bridge user choices and ensure that consumers can express their preferences to various parties in the advertising ecosystem through a standard format: the AdChoices Signal. This signal is generated by the WebChoices tool and stored in the Protect My Choices browser extension:

## Getting Started
To understand how to integrate with the DAA AdChoices ecosystem, we recommend reviewing the specifications in the following order:

1. **AdChoices Signal Specification:** Understand the core data format for user preferences.
2. **WebChoices Implementation Instructions:** For companies that need to integrate their opt-out infrastructure with the centralized DAA opt-out tool, especially for non-cookie technologies.
3. **Protect My Choices v2.0 Technical Specifications:** Understand how to access user preferences directly from the browser extension via JavaScript or HTTP headers.

Each specification provides examples and detailed field descriptions to aid in implementation.

## Participation & Next Steps
If you’re already a DAA participant, these tools are available to you now in the U.S., Canada, and Argentina (no extra jurisdictional cost at this time). Future fees may apply.

## About the DAA and AdChoices
The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) is a non-profit industry self-regulatory body backed by leading advertising trade associations. For over a decade, we've run the AdChoices program, which gives consumers transparency (clear notice) and control (easy-to-use tools) over interest-based advertising (IBA), which is sometimes called online behavioral advertising.

The AdChoices Icon is the program's most visible element. It appears on ads, websites, and apps, and links users to information about data collection and their privacy options. It's served trillions of times per month worldwide and is recognized by consumers as a privacy signal and way to understand who has delivered an ad to them.
